/*
You can also nest arrays within other arrays, like this: [["Bulls", 23], ["White Sox", 45]]. This is also called a Multi-dimensional Array.


Create a nested array called myArray.

// Example
var ourArray = [["the universe", 42], ["everything", 101010]];

// Only change code below this line.
var myArray = [["I am tired", 11], ["I don't want to go to work tomorrow", 24]];
