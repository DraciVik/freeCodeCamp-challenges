/*
var keyword is that you can overwrite variable declarations without an error.

var camper = 'James';
var camper = 'David';
console.log(camper);
// logs 'David'
As you can see in the code above, the camper variable is originally declared as James and then overridden to be David.

In a small application, you might not run into this type of problem, but when your code becomes larger, you might accidently overwrite a variable that you did not intend to overwrite.

Because this behavior does not throw an error, searching and fixing bugs becomes more difficult.

A new keyword called let was introduced in ES6 to solve this potential issue with the var keyword.

If you were to replace var with let in the variable declarations of the code above, the result would be an error.

let camper = 'James';
let camper = 'David'; // throws an error
This error can be seen in the console of your browser.

So unlike var, when using let, a variable with the same name can only be declared once.


Update the code so it only uses the let keyword.

Note
Remember that since let prevents variables from being overridden, you will need to remove one of the declarations entirely.
