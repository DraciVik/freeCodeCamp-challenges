<!--
Again, here's a diagram of an a element for your reference:

a diagram of how anchor tags are composed with the same text as on the following line

Here's an example:

<p>Here's a <a href="https://freecodecamp.org"> link to freeCodeCamp</a> for you to follow.</p>

Nesting just means putting one element inside of another element.


Now nest your existing a element within a new p element (just after the existing main element) so that the surrounding paragraph says "View more cat photos", but where only "cat photos" is a link, and the rest of the text is plain text.
-->
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>

<p>View more <a href="http://freecatphotoapp.com" target="_blank">cat photos</a></p>

  <img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back.">
