Basic HTML and HTML5: Create a Set of Radio Buttons
You can use radio buttons for questions where you want the user to only give you one answer out of multiple options.

Radio buttons are a type of input

Each of your radio buttons should be nested within its own label element.

All related radio buttons should have the same name attribute.

Here's an example of a radio button:

<label for="indoor">
 <input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">Indoor
</label>
It is considered best practice to set the for attribute for assistive technologies to be able to link the relationship between the label and the child elements such as an input in this case.


Add a pair of radio buttons to your form. One should have the option of indoor and the other should have the option of outdoor. Both should share the name attribute of indoor-outdoor.
