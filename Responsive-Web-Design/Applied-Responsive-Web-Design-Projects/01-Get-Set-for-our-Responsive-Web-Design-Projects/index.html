An intro that projects are hard but best for remembering topics. It provides an intro on how to use CodePen but it also says how to add Bootstrap. The problem is that in the beta the Bootstrap tutorial is moved to the front-end-libraries so there are no challenges for it up untill this point. Maybe it's a legacy problem that has not been reviewed yet.
